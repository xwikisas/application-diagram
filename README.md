Diagram Application (Pro)
=========================

Create various types of diagrams using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

This application integrates [jgraph/draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/) and supports both editing and viewing diagrams. Each diagram is stored in a wiki page. It doesn't require any external services in order to work properly.
